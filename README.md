## Description
This repository serves as the official [UNIBZ](www.unibz.it) project for creating custom KNIME nodes dedicated to image processing using Python. The repository aims to provide a seamless integration between KNIME's workflow analytics platform and the powerful capabilities of Python for image analysis and processing tasks.

With this project, users can:

    Develop custom KNIME nodes tailored for specific image processing requirements.
    Leverage Python libraries and tools for advanced image manipulation and analysis.
    Simplify workflows by combining KNIME's no-code/low-code environment with Python's scripting flexibility.


## Installation
step1 --> config.yml set the path for src and conda envirioment
step2 --> in knime dir find the knimi.ini file and add a line at the end of the file
`-Dknime.python.extension.config=path/to/config/config.yml`


## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
